        1. Visit the W3Schools HTML documentation at https://www.w3schools.com/html/.
        2. Search for "HTML Tables" and read about how to create tables.
        3. Copy an example of a table and paste it below. Modify the table to include information about your favorite books (e.g., title, author, year).
        4. Next, go to the W3Schools CSS documentation at https://www.w3schools.com/css/.
        5. Search for "CSS Tables" and read about styling tables.
        6. Copy an example that demonstrates how to style tables and implement it on your page. Experiment with borders, background colors, and text alignment.
        7. Create a new section on the page with a few images related to your favorite books. Use the <img> tag and ensure to include the alt attribute for accessibility.
        8. Link your external stylesheet (styles.css) to further style your page. Add colors, padding, and fonts to enhance the overall design.
        9. Finally, explore any additional HTML elements or CSS properties you find interesting in the documentation!
